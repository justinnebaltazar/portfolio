                   My interests mostly includes Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I have been expanding my web development skills 
                   -- self-learning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also familiar with Python, C, and C++. This website serves as a way to show my side projects, experience and 
                   as a personal log for the resources that I personally found to be useful.
